# Project Title
Ramen Rater

## Simple Overview of Use/Purpose
The Ramen Rater is a web application that allows users to browse, rate, and manage their favorite ramen dishes. Users can view a list of ramens, see detailed information about each ramen, add new ramens via a form, and delete ramens they no longer want to keep track of.

## Description
The Ramen Rater project is a dynamic web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a clean, user-friendly interface where users can explore a collection of ramen dishes displayed as clickable images in a menu. Clicking a ramen reveals its details, including its name, restaurant, rating, and comments. The app includes a form to add new ramens, with fields for name, restaurant, image URL, rating, and comments, and a delete button to remove ramens from the list. This project demonstrates fundamental web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design, making it a great tool for ramen enthusiasts to catalog their culinary experiences.
